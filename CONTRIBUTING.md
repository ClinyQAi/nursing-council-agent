# Contributing to Nursing Council Agent 🩺

**Welcome, Nurse Citizen Developers!**

This project is built on the belief that **nurses are the best designers of nursing tools**. You do NOT need to be a "coder" to contribute. We value your clinical expertise, educational experience, and critical thinking above all else.

## 🌟 How You Can Help (No Coding Required)

### 1. Suggest a New "Council Member"
The agent uses personas (like "The Academic" or "The Clinical Mentor"). We need more!
- **Idea:** Do we need a "Patient Safety Officer"? A "Mental Health Specialist"?
- **How to submit:** Open a [New Persona Request](https://github.com/ClinyQAi/nursing-council-agent/issues/new?template=new_persona.yml) issue.

### 2. Improve the Feedback
If the AI gives advice that doesn't align with current NMC standards or UK practice:
- **Report it:** Let us know specifically what was wrong and how a human expert would have corrected it.

### 3. Share Your Scenarios
Have you used the agent to review a lesson plan? Share your prompt! Real-world examples help us tune the system.

## 👩‍💻 For Technical Contributors

If you are comfortable with code, we use a **modern AI stack**:
- **Frontend:** React (Vite)
- **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
- **AI:** Azure OpenAI / GPT-4o

### Local Development
1. Fork the repo.
2. Run `npm install` in `frontend/` and `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example`).
4. Submit a Pull Request (PR) linked to an issue.

## 🤝 Community Standards

We adhere to a Code of Conduct inspired by the **NMC Code**:
*   **Prioritize People:** Be kind and patient with beginners.
*   **Practice Effectively:** Share evidence-based improvements.
*   **Preserve Safety:** Do not share real patient data or private student information in issues.
