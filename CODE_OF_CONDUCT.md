# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge to Each Other

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Standards of Behaviour

Since this project represents the Nursing profession, we align our community expectations with the **The Code (NMC)**:

1.  **Prioritise People**: Treat every contributor with kindness, compassion, and respect.
2.  **Practice Effectively**: Share knowledge generously. When offering critique on code or clinical prompts, do so constructively and evidence-based.
3.  **Preserve Safety**: **NEVER** post real patient observations, private student data, or sensitive institutional passwords in issues or pull requests.
4.  **Promote Professionalism and Trust**: Act with integrity. Be honest about capabilities and limitations.

### Examples of positive behaviour include:
*   Using welcoming and inclusive language.
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
*   Focusing on what is best for the community.
*   Showing empathy towards other community members.

### Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:
*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
*   Public or private harassment.
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.

## Enforcement

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 1.4, and the **NMC Code**.
