## About

The **Nursing Council Agent** is an AI-powered multi-perspective peer review tool designed specifically for nursing education. It leverages the "**Council of Models**" approach—originally pioneered by [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy/llm-council)—to provide comprehensive, balanced feedback on educational content.

This project demonstrates how **Generative AI** can enhance quality assurance in curriculum design while promoting the "**Nurse as Citizen Developer**" movement, empowering nursing professionals to build bespoke AI tools without deep software engineering expertise.

### Key Features

- 🎓 **Multi-Perspective Review**: Three AI personas (Academic, Clinical Mentor, Student Advocate) provide diverse feedback
- 🔑 **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)**: Use your own API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, or DeepSeek
- 💾 **Persistent History**: Conversations saved securely via Azure Blob Storage
- 📄 **Export to PDF**: Generate professional feedback reports
- 🎭 **Custom Roles**: Add specialized reviewers (e.g., "Dementia Specialist", "Public Health Lead")
- 🔐 **Enterprise Ready**: Azure AD authentication for organizational security

## The Council Approach

Instead of asking one AI for feedback, the **Nursing Council** convenes three AI "experts" who each bring a different perspective:

| Role | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 🎓 **The Academic** | NMC Standards alignment, evidence-based practice, scholarly rigor |
| 🏥 **The Clinical Mentor** | Ward realism, clinical applicability, compassionate care |
| 👩‍🎓 **The Student Advocate** | Accessibility, clarity, diverse learning needs |

The **Head of Nursing Education** (Chairman) then synthesizes their feedback into actionable recommendations.

## Quick Start

### Hugging Face Spaces (Easiest)
Visit the [Live Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/NurseCitizenDeveloper/Nursing-Council-Agent-V2) and use the Settings ⚙️ icon to configure your own API key.

### Local Development (GitHub Codespaces)
1. **Fork this repository** to your GitHub account.
2. Click the green **"Code"** button → **"Open with Codespaces"**.
3. Create a `.env` file with your credentials.
4. Run `./start.sh` and make port **8001** public.

### Azure Deployment
This repository is optimized for **Azure Container Apps**:
- `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` / `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`: For LLM access
- `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING`: For persistent history
- Enable **Easy Auth** (Microsoft provider) for enterprise security
